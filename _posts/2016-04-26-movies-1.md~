### The problem

So for our second project, an exercise in scraping web data about movies, I wanted to know what going to the movies, that classic American pasttime, could tell us about suffering economic recession, that other classic American pasttime.

In sort of faux-economic conventional wisdom, there are two newsy indicators relating consumption of consumer goods to national economic health via women's bodies.

The lipstick index, proposed by some Estee Lauder dude in the 2000s, suggests that women buy more lipstick during downturns because it's an affordable luxury that substitutes for more expensive purchases. (This is now being referred to in many places as the 'nailpolish index' in an attempt to increase newsiness even more.)

The hemline index, proposed by some economist dude in the 1920s, suggests that women's skirts get shorter as the economy gets better because ... consumer confidence?

So: **Are movies lipsticks and/or hemlines?**

#### No Sale
*- Elizabeth Taylor, BUtterfield 8*

All right, so if movies are lipsticks, we expect sales to go up during bad economic times, perhaps because people are substituting (relatively) cheap entertainment for more expensive ballgames, vacations, etc. [This article](http://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-4/movies-music-sports-entertainment-spending.htm) suggests that while entertainment spending fell during the last recession, ticket sales, including movies, actually peaked in 2009.

According to [the-numbers.com](http://www.the-numbers.com/market/), estimated ticket sales have been fairly constant over the last twenty years, with a peak of 1.6m in 2003. We're still seeing about as many movies a year as we were in 1996-ish: approximately 1.3m.

Apparently, a fairly new indicator, the [popcorn index](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1205181/Want-know-future-economy-Just-consult-popcorn-index.html), suggests that popcorn sales at movies reflect consumers' stance on discretionary income and can therefore predict economic performance. The idea here is that people are fairly determined to  see the movies they want to see, but whether they buy candy/popcorn/soda or not is much more responsive to the economy.

#### Flying skirts

So it seems that movies as a whole might fit a particular class of economic indicator: the comfort good. But what kind of comfort do people get from movies? Do they want to be distracted with lighthearted antics or do they prefer darker movies that are more reflective of the national mood?

This is essentially what it means to look at movies as hemlines. I'm agnostic as to what exactly 'shorter' means in a film mood/genre context, but the idea is that economic trends will have some effect on the _content_ of movies, both in terms of what is made and what is watched.

#### Genre competition

My project focuses on a subsection of this question, namely: *is movie performance affected by what's in theaters at the same time?*

You can imagine a substitution effect wherein similar movies that are released at the same time split a potentially-interested audience. Contrasting movies might perform better as a unique offering within a glut of similar options. Alternatively, there might be a bandwagoning effect wherein a certain set of movies (lately: superheroes, recently: post-apocalyptic fights to the death) reflects high interest in those categories.

You can already see the problem, right? These aren't the same measure of similarity. For the purposes of this project, I'm measuring similarity on a genre axis (i.e. comedy, drama, etc.). (More on this later.) The problem is that the broader genre category subsumes content differences that are more subject to passing trends. This isn't a huge issue if you consider all action-adventure films to be similar _enough_, but it might be more interesting to look at more content-based attributes such as tone. (Which again cannot be separated from content, a Batman movie being on average much less weepy than a historical drama, except in the case of Terminator 2, which had the most tragic movie death (at least to five-year-old me) of all time.) Movies may be more substitutable based on mood than genre, a dark comedy and a dark action film actually being more tonally similar than a buddy-cop movie and a kidnapping thriller.

Additionally, any competition effect is likely to be different across genres, in part because popularity is driven by content and is temporally bounded. A superhero movie might do better even when released in a month (or whatever period) with a bunch of others because that kind of movie is popular at that time. That is probably only true of, say, 2015, though, while there's high interest in superheros in general.

Then, movies are made with precisely this in mind, right? One superhero movie success spawns a bunch of others. Adding to this causality problem is the fact that studios work together to schedule movie releases to avoid such audience splitting. 

The problem isn't just on the supply side; it's also about understanding the dynamics of the demand side. We need to know more about audience decision-making, since any competition effect depends on the limits of movie-going. Do people see as many movies as they are interested in, or do they choose their top selections for a limited number of theater excursions? 

#### Variables

Nevertheless, I present a very rough cut:

'opening weekend gross = competition + budget + director + actor + season'

- *Opening weekend*: The dependent variable here is a movie's performance on its opening weekend. Basically, in my model, a movie enters the market. There are certain movies that are already out and some that will soon come out, during its lifespan. How do people choose or not choose this movie? I am specifically not trying to predict longevity (which in many ways is a better indicator of a film's quality). I am also trying to avoid the problem with domestic total gross, which is dependent on the number of weeks a movie stays in movies, which is again subject to studio/theater decision-making (largely based on opening weekend revenue!). In addition, using dtg requires accounting for movies entering and exiting the marketplace over the lifespan of the movie in question, which would be interesting for future analysis, but is unfortunately outside the scope of my question for now.

As one of my classmates pointed out, however, there is a significant number of people who specifically avoid opening weekend. This is a problem if this preference is correlated with the type of movie/type of movie-goer. It's not an unlikely case, given that some movie genres, e.g. horror,  appear to be one-shot deals where all the people who are going to see it do so when it comes out, with relatively little additional viewership trickling in during later weeks.

- *Competition*: I measure this with the proportion of 'similar' movies in movie theaters. 'Similar' in this case refers to movies that fall in the same genre. In the dataset (more on this later), there are 65 unique genre categories among 2400 movies between 1980 and today. I recategorized these into 10 genre bins, 5 bins, and binary comedy/non-comedy indicator. This was a bit of an exercise in common sense and reading plot summaries on Wikipedia, since sometimes it's hard to tell which genre is modifying the other in a dual listing. I found this particularly difficult for sci-fi/fantasy movies. Is sff just a setting for an action film, or is there something fundamentally different about them? Why is Action Fantasy an Action film but Fantasy Drama a Fantasy film? I looked at all the entries in the ambiguous categories, but ultimately it was sort of arbitrarily decided by me.

This process creates genres of different size/specificity, especially at the ten-genre level, where all kinds of action films are lumped together, but westerns are still westerns. In part I wanted to keep western, war, and crime films out as genres of interest, since they are highly tied to tone and, I hypothesize, perhaps more responsive to economic shifts. However, this isn't really a fair comparison.

By the way, the 5-genre cut combines horror and sff into a 'genre' category, in the sense of 'genre fiction.' The idea here is that these works are not really mainstream interest (though I think this effect is decreasing over time in both books and movies).

Obviously this problem goes away as the genres are collapsed further, but they risk losing meaning. In the end, the binary options are comedy/non-comedy, a sort of Grecian Thalia/Melpomene classification.

![genre recode](/assets/genrecollapse.png)

Theoretically, competition may matter at different levels. If substitution happens on a subgenre basis (which seems more intuitive; a war drama is quite different from a family drama, but romcoms are more similar), any effects will be washed out with larger groupings. Of course, the more specific you get, the more unique movies look to both audiences and studios, so it's unlikely in the first place that you'll get two lavish period epics at the same time. (Er, unless, of course, there is a current post-Downton Abbey vogue, for example.)

The actual variable is calculated as the percentage of similar movies in the given timeframe, so a higher score means more movies in the same genre are out at the time. Naturally, the more genres that are included, the lower this score will be (on average) for all movies, simply because there's a higher chance of uniqueness.

For control variables, as a person who knows very little about movies, I did a quick lit review. There are quite a few papers that are concerned with predicting movie performance, and the variables most commonly included are:

- *Budget*: Most studies did indicate a positive relationship between budget and performance. However, it's not necessarily the case that people like expensive fancy-looking movies overall.  Budget reflects studio expectations (in turn based on previous franchise/director/writer performance), type of movie (e.g. romances less expensive than war films), etc. One thing to note is that budget numbers often include the marketing allowance as well, which is not necessarily proportional to the actual movie-making budget.

- *Director*: I use the average domestic total gross for previous movies made by the director. If multiple directors, I take the average.

- *Actor*: Same thing here, average prior movie performance. I take the average of the 'stars' of the cast because I make a theoretical assumption that two established stars are more of a draw than just one. Other papers and classmates have just used the best performer with the logic that people see movies primarily based on the main actor.

- *Season*: I include a summer dummy to account for the effect of seasonal movie release, though it doesn't actually take care of the interaction problem that arises because more action blockbusters are released during the summer and they also do better. (In the future I would also include a winter dummy to account for Oscar season, having just learned about this effect via other presentations.)

About timeframes: I try a couple of different intervals around a movie's release date. It may be the case that the only competition that matters is what is actually in theaters when the movie comes out and while the movie is out (which, given an average six-week run, I capture with a one-month interval around the release date). Alternatively, people may have more memory/anticipationabout what they will see. This may be the case if subject fatigue sets in, e.g. a backlash to superhero movies. I therefore also try a six-month window centered around the movie release. Finally, in the case that people are _only_ influenced by memory and driven by novelty, I try finding all similar movies only within the month prior to a movie's open.

### Data scraping

All of my data was taken from [boxofficemojo.com](http://boxofficemojo.com), to whom I am thankful for ignoring my hesistant scraping efforts. Must have felt like being tickled on the inside by a shy robot grandma.

To reduce the scope of the data collection (mostly driven by concerns about availability), I started with all movies from the 'Big Six' major studios from 1980. There are some issues with this approach, namely that 'major studio' designation changes over time, and that some non-major studios actually put out more movies per year than majors. Lions Gate in particular has nearly the same market share as Paramount. The idea is that major movies will dominate the perception of what movies are available at a given time, and that they are more direct competitors with each other than limited-run independent movies. If, however, release is correlated with studio type, genre diversity will be underrepresented in this sample.

Unfortunately there's a lot of missing data across all fields, especially budget. Not all directors and actors have pages, and not all of those who do have full movie history. This is problematic because again, missingness appears to be somewhat correlated to the success of the movie and prominence of the director/actor (though not always -- Michael J. Fox doesn't have a page, for instance!). 

<small>Some notes on actor information: I didn't exclude cameo appearances in the actor totals. The effect of this is unclear, as more successful actors have more of these roles, but the movies didn't necessarily perform well or even better than their main-billed movies. Also, I noticed that animation films didn't have prominent voice actors until more recently in the dataset. It'd be interesting to see if that actually contributes to financial success.</small>

Missingness is probably most obviously also a product of time: BOM was started in 1999 so there's a significant jump in quantity of data.

In the end, I restricted my data to movies with *no* missing values across fields in the period 1999-2015, which was serious limitation. The final dataset consistent of approximately 1200 entries.

The missing data problem is easily fixable by getting cast info from IMDb.com, and [the-numbers.com](http://the-numbers.com) has more complete data on budget and history.
