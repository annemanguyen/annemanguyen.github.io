The last couple of weeks I've been having a bit of a crisis of faith. 

For the most part, my background as a former political scientist with some graduate training in statistics has been extremely useful. To some extent, though, the most interesting (and probably most important) thing that I'm trying to learn -- how to transition from sort of academic data use and manipulation to practical data science -- is also the most challenging. (Philosophically, anyway. For 'most mentally challenging' please see 'what on earth is Bayesian time series' and 'why do I keep forgetting to rename just that one variable every time'.)

Let's back up for a second. One of the main reasons I left academia is that I became less and less convinced that the current methods in use are ill-suited to capturing anything about the world. There's a push toward more math-y, science-y 'hardening' of the field (in the sense of moving away from being a 'soft' social science) that is unfortunately at odds with studying the type of phenomena that make the field sort of substantively interesting. Real-world events, particularly the ones we would love to explain, such as war, regime change, state formation, etc., are rare, self-selecting events that we can only observe, and they are messy processes for which the inputs are often hard to identify and measure.

The dream underlying political science as a discipline is a seductive one, I think. In college, I had lofty ideals of discovering *just one small true thing* about the world, of adding to the cumulative store of human knowledge. I'm now much less hubristic and much more skeptical of that notion, but I think I would still be sympathetic to the search if the process hadn't become nearly pathological due to the peculiarities of academia. 

<s>Related: it is with a certain amount of chagrin that I often find insights from political science (oten lauded as 'surprising and yet not counter-intuitive' and having required a very large and sophisticated amount of work to uncover) casually mentioned as a widely understood insight or conventional wisdom in novels and newspaper articles.</s>

> "(a) we don’t know enough at this point to do this exactly right and (b) in the future, what it’s taking me seven years to do with a mathematical model is going to take a computer hours, or seconds.” -- [Irene Pepperberg](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/05/12/birdbrain)

Just read this tonight while looking up Alex videos and was struck by how I feel the same way about a completely different field (Dr. Pepperberg was in theoretical chemistry). In particular, I think about all of those papers and books published in the 1990s that have simple regression models rife with endogeneity and that are basically worthless today. To that extent, I think qualitative stuff can hold more longterm value, even if it turns out to be "wrong."

In my Metis interview with Laurie Skelly (a very cool lady), we commiserated about academic research essentially being pushed into impracticality by the stringent requirements of making causal claims. If I want to *explain* certain phenomena
